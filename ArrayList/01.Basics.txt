Just like vectors of c++. Basically dynamic array ie arrays that can expand dynamically

*)Elements in an ArrayList are actually objects.
  Remember that a String in Java is an object (not a primitive type). To use other types, such as int, you must specify an equivalent wrapper class: Integer.
  For  other primitive types, use: Boolean for boolean, Character for char, Double for double

Basic working
1)When we declare and intilize the arraylist eg ArrayList <String>=new ArrayList<>();
Then an empty array is declared.
2)When we add the first element an array of size 10 is made
3)when 10 elemnts havebeen added in the array,now the size will be expanded.
4)The expansion is given by new_size=n+n/2+1 where n=current size

Difference between array size and array capacity
  We can declare the array with a predefined size instead of 0 eg ArrayList<int>v=new ArrayList(10);
  here the capacity is 10,which means the max elements that the array can store without expanding is 10.
  whereas the size is 0,which you guessed perfectly,is the number of elements currently present in the array.

*)We can print the array just we can print the list and other data structures in python System.out.print(array_name)

*)The time complexity of add at index/delete at index is O(n)
